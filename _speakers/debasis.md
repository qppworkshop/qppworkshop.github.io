content-speak: Query Performance Prediction (QPP) has mainly been studied for more than two decades as a focused sun-topic in Information Retrieval. The community has worked towards developing more effective models for predicting the performance of a diverse range of ranking models, and in this talk I’m going to provide a very brief review of the existing classes of QPP models from unsupervised to supervised to query-variant based approaches. However, a more important problem to which I want to draw the attention of the research community is that of a downstream application of QPP in developing adaptive systems. I’m going to talk about two distinct use-cases: the first, a more direct application of QPP for improving the workflow of IR systems by incorporating a dynamic query-specific pipeline. And the second, a more subtle connection between QPP and RAG, where I will be first talking about how  QPP techniques might be used to estimate the usefulness of a RAG context eventually providing some high-level pointers on how this might actually be applied to develop input-specific adaptive RAG pipelines.
bio: Debasis Ganguly has been working as an assistant professor in the University of Glasgow, UK. He was a former research scientist in IBM Research, Ireland, where he worked on information extraction and verification of scientific claims. His general research goals are directed towards predicting performance of AI models, fair, interpretable and trustworthy AI models, and privacy-preserving AI models. Over the years he has published over a hundred research papers in top tier conferences and journals, namely SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR, TOIS, IPM etc.
