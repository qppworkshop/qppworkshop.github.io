                    In the field of information retrieval (IR), harnessing knowledge from external knowledge bases, such
                    as Knowledge Graphs and Wikipedia, has emerged as a promising avenue for improving the effectiveness
                    and the interpretability of IR systems. These external knowledge bases offer valuable information
                    that empowers IR models to make more accurate predictions. The infusion of external knowledge bases
                    into IR models can provide enhanced ranking results and greater interpretability, offering
                    substantial advancements in the field.
                    <br><br>
                    The First Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2024) will serve as a
                    platform to bring together researchers from academia and industry to explore and discuss various
                    aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval systems, such as models, techniques, data
                    collection and evaluation. The workshop aims to not only deliberate upon the advantages and hurdles
                    intrinsic to the development of knowledge-enhanced PLMs, IR models and RecSys models but also to
                    facilitate in-depth discussions concerning the same.

    <h4>Knowledge-enhanced Conversational Recommender Systems</h4>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have revolutionized how we interact with the recommender by discerning user preferences through iterative dialogues. However, the effectiveness of these systems is often hindered by a need for more contextual understanding for precise preference modeling. Integrating various external knowledge sources offers promising solutions to enrich dialogue context, predict user preferences, and generate informative responses. This presentation will delve into recent advancements in the realm of knowledge-enhanced CRS, spotlighting studies that leverage knowledge to refine recommendations and enrich user interactions. I will share insights from our recent research that bolsters the recommendation quality and the informativeness of conversational responses. Additionally, I will illuminate emerging research trajectories within this domain, emphasizing the synergy between CRS and Large Language Models.</p>

      <b>Bio</b><br />
      Dr. Zhaochun Ren is an Associate Professor at Leiden University, the Netherlands. He is interested in information retrieval and natural language processing, with an emphasis on conversational artificial intelligence, recommender systems, and social media analysis. He aims to develop intelligent agents that can address complex user requests and solve core challenges in NLP and IR towards that goal.

    <h4>Utilizing Structured and Encoded Knowledge for Search</h4>
    <p><b>Abstract</b><br>At Bloomberg, we build search applications for financial professionals as a part of our main product, the Bloomberg Terminal. In this talk, we will provide an illustration of a typical search workflow at Bloomberg, and discuss 1) how structured and encoded knowledge could be utilized end-to-end in a search system, and 2) challenges in applying them effectively at each step. Early in the pipeline, knowledge can be used to enrich and organize documents in the searchable collection. Thus, we start by discussing the document understanding step. Then, we consider the challenges of interpreting queries correctly and applying the appropriate retrieval configuration needed to satisfy the user’s information needs. We then continue to discuss the utilization of such enriched knowledge for document retrieval and reranking. Lastly, since user experience (UX) plays an important role in the search process, we will also discuss open questions around designing the user experience that is guided by knowledge.</p>
